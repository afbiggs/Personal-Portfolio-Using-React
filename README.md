# TO WHOMEVER MAY BE GRADING THIS REPO/WEBSITE FOR THE FULL-STACK BOTCAMP!!!

## When I submitted the assignement on the bcs, I originally stated how my website was not functional and included a video of me explainging that. Within a couple of hours since submiting the assignment on bcs I have finally got the website up and running. The reason I am not re-submitting on bcs is because all assignmetns had to be turned in by the end of the day and I do not want to send a submission that is clearly past the cut-off time and therefor does not get graded at all. I hope that whomever is grading my assignment will allow for this to count the same as if I was to submmit the website URL through bcs because I really did spend a lot of time on this website. I had already completed the large majority of the code, and the video I had submitted will prove that. The reason I kept having issues deploying was due to out of date Node modules. Some of the packages I had installed for the the functionality of the website required newer versions of other packages and it took me a while to decipher the error messages to get to the proper conclusion.
